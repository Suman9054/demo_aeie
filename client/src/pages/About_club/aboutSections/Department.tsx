        Department of Applied Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering <br /> </h2>
    <p>The Department of Applied Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering at Haldia Institute of Technology (HIT), established in 1996, is a forward-looking academic unit committed to producing skilled professionals in the fields of instrumentation, control systems, and industrial automation. The department follows an Outcome-Based Education (OBE) structure, which emphasizes measurable learning outcomes and continuous improvement. This approach ensures that students not only acquire theoretical knowledge but also develop critical problem-solving, analytical, and design skills tailored to industry demands. The OBE framework is implemented through clearly defined Program Educational Objectives (PEOs), Program Outcomes (POs), and Course Outcomes (COs), all aligned with national and international engineering education standards. Instrumentation and automation engineering, being an interdisciplinary field, integrates principles from electronics, electrical engineering, and computer science to create and maintain systems that monitor and control industrial processes. AEIE department provides a strong academic and practical foundation through state-of-the-art laboratories, real-time project work, and industry-relevant training modules in areas such as embedded systems, industrial instrumentation, and PLC/SCADA systems. The department nurtures a vibrant academic environment supported by qualified faculty, regular seminars, industry visits, and technical workshops. It offers excellent training and placement opportunities, with students regularly placed in top-tier organizations in both core and IT sectors. A well-established alumni network further strengthens the department, with former students achieving success in global companies, higher education institutions, and research organizations. The achievements of these alumni stand as a testament to the department's academic rigor and its commitment to developing industry-ready graduates. For those aspiring to build a successful career in instrumentation and automation, the Department of Applied Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering at HIT offers a highly supportive and promising platform.
